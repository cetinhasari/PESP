<h4>Abstract</h4>

Mathematical optimization in public transport area is becoming a very popular task for the several last years. Periodic timetables are widely used for local, regional, and long-distance traffic because periodic timetable has the property that certain departure times occure in fixed intervals which ensures a very regular service. Timetable is a very important factor in public transport organization: it helps to optimize city resources, provide mobility and reasonable travel times for many people. In current work we have considered step-by-step model construction, formulation as integer linear programming and two ways of solving the task: classical Branch and Bound and genetic algorithm.
